                          programming: html, css3, jQuery, javaScript;
                          programming: 'calculate' in = [Java, c++, Visual Basic, c#, python] 
                        }
                        
- 🌱 I’m currently learning { jQuery;
                               javaScript;
                               styling the complete site;
                             }
